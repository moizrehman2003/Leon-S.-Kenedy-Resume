        <h1>Objective:</h1>
To leverage my unique experiences in surviving zombie outbreaks and rescuing the president's daughter to excel in the field of Computer Science, bringing unparalleled problem-solving skills and a knack for staying calm under pressure to any team.

<h1>Education:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Raccoon City University, Raccoon City, USA <br>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science </li>
    <li>GPA: 3.9</li>
    <li>Completed rigorous coursework in programming languages, algorithms, and data structures, while simultaneously fending off hordes of infected creatures.</li>
  </ul>
<h1>Experience</h1>
Umbrella Corporation, Raccoon City, USA
Computer Science Intern
Developed innovative software solutions for biohazard containment systems, including a virus detection algorithm that unfortunately failed to recognize T-Virus infections.
Assisted in troubleshooting and maintaining complex computer systems in high-pressure situations, such as during outbreaks of viral infection.
Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to improve security protocols, although it's worth noting that zombies are surprisingly resilient against firewalls.
<h1>Skills:</h1>

Proficient in Java, C++, and Python, as well as a variety of firearms including pistols, shotguns, and rocket launchers.
Experienced in debugging code and zombie infestations with equal efficiency.
Strong communication skills, proven through negotiations with hostile entities and delivering presentations on software development strategies to fellow survivors.
Quick learner, adept at adapting to new environments, whether it's a university lecture hall or a decaying mansion filled with genetically engineered monstrosities.
<h1>Projects:</h1>

Developed a mobile app to track viral outbreaks and nearby safe zones, unfortunately, user feedback suggested it was more effective at attracting zombies than avoiding them.
Led a team to implement a real-time multiplayer survival game prototype, drawing on personal experiences navigating treacherous environments while evading pursuers.
Certifications:

Certified Zombie Apocalypse Survivor (CZAS): Granted by the Raccoon City Emergency Response Team for demonstrating exceptional skills in evading the undead and protecting civilians.
Certified in CPR and First Aid: Acquired during training sessions with the Raccoon City Police Department, because sometimes saving lives is more about defibrillators than debugging.
<h1>Languages:</h1>

English (Native), Spanish (Basic), Zombie (Fluent)
